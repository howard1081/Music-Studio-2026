**[Verse 1]**  
Keys on the counter, sink won't quit drip-drip  
Hoodie on the chair like you might still fit  
Cold linoleum under my socked feet  
I told myself "fine" but the house don't believe it  
Gripping the counter, breathing like I rehearsed it  
The routine's a mask and it's starting to slip

**[Verse 2]**  
Badge on the dash, shift ended twenty back  
Engine ticking cold, keys still in my hand  
Can't bring myself to start it up and leave  
Phone on the console, who would I even call  
Sitting in the cold 'cause I got nowhere else  
The pretending stopped working in this parking lot

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Thumb over "send" on a text I never wanted  
If I say it out loud it becomes real

**[Chorus]**  
I was running from You in my own loud head  
But You got close when the whole thing bled  
Hands shaking, breathing like I can't catch it  
You were near in the wreckage

**[Verse 3]**  
Motel carpet, 2am, sitting on the floor  
Ice machine humming three doors down the hall  
Got the room but I can't make myself go in  
Phone in my hand with the screen turned way down  
Back against the wall, knees pulled to my chest  
This is the most honest I've been in months

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Thumb over "send" on a text I never wanted  
If I say it out loud it becomes real

**[Chorus]**  
I was running from You in my own loud head  
But You got close when the whole thing bled  
Hands shaking, breathing like I can't catch it  
You were near in the wreckage

**[Bridge]**  
Dashboard glow, typed "I can't do this alone"  
Stared at it for ten minutes, hands finally showing  
Hit send this time, didn't delete it  
No reply yet but I'm not hiding anymore  
Still broken but You're here

**[Final Chorus]**  
I was running from You in my own loud head  
But You got close when the whole thing bled  
Hands shaking, breathing like I can't catch it  
You were near in the wreckage
